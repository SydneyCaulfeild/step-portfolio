        <p>I was born in Toronto and moved to Ottawa when I was 7. Growing up I loved all sports; I did soccer, figure skating, tennis, swimming and gymnastics. My passion was strongest for soccer, and in high school I was captain of a provincial soccer team with the West Ottawa Soccer Club.</p>
        <p>I also have a strong love for music. I began playing piano at the age of seven and during high school I founded and ran a private piano teaching company.</p>
