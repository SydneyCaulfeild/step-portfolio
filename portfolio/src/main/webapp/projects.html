            <h2>2020 - Robot Racing</h2>
            <p>I collaborated on a team of four in my Mechatronics course to control a small motorized robot. We had to do all wire configurations and write code for the robot to find a paper target in a room as fast as possible. We used controlled the robot using Arduino and relied on IR sensors and the robot's bumpers to find the target.</p>

            <h2>2019 - Vehicular Hyperthermia Prevention Project</h2>
            <p>I worked on a team of four in my Engineering Design course to design and test a system that would detect if a child or pet is forgotten in your car to prevent vehicular hyperthermia. Our final design included a combination of motion cameras, pressure sensors and a microphone that were controlled with a Wi-Fi enabled Arduino. The system sent an alert to the car owner's phone if it detected a child or pet.</p>

            <h2>2018 - Queen's Space Engineering Team</h2>
            <p>In my first year of University I joined the Attitude Determination and Control System team on Queen's Space Engineering Team where I worked on a interactive model of a satellite in MatLab. In my second year, I spearheaded an Onboarding Program where I developed and taught weekly lessons to 30 new meembers on subjects such as GitHub and space science.</p>
