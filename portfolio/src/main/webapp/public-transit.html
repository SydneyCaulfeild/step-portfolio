    <p class="content">Last summer I had to travel to my job using OC Transpo, Ottawa's public transit system. Each trip, there and back, involved taking several buses and took nearly an hour and a half. This was the first time in my life I had to seriously rely on public transportation, and it got me thinking about others who may need public transit but don't have access. The graph below shows the percentage of accessible passenger stations and terminals in each province in 2016. As you can see, 100% is achievable but it is unfortunately not the reality in all provinces. Furthermore, it is important that we expand our data collection to cover all provinces and territories.</p>

    <p class="content">When possible, I would much rather bike than take the bus. Take a look at this map to checkout some of my favourite bike paths in Ottawa! All bike paths are highlighted in bright green.</p>

    <ul class="content">
      <li><b>A:</b> The Ottawa River Pathway goes all along the Ottawa River. If you are too from the path to bike, I recommend parking at Britannia beach because it's a great place to have lunch and go for a swim and it's close enough that you can follow the river to downtown and back.</li></br>
      <li><b>B:</b> On the other side of the Ottawa River there are endless biking trails in Gatineau. This one is the Voyageurs Pathway and it follows the Ottawa River from the Quebec side. You can park at "17-19 Rue Wright Parking" and go South on Sentier du Ruisseau-de-la-Brasserie. You'll then cross Alexandre-Tache Blvd at the intersection and meet up with the Sentier des Voyageurs where I recommend going west.</li></br>
      <li><b>C:</b> Although it's not as fun as skating on the Rideau Canal, the canal has pathways on both the east and west sides that take you straight to downtown where you can checkout Parliament and the Chateau Laurier. I like to park at Dow's lake to avoid the traffic closer to downtown and bike north on the Eastern Pathway.</li></br>
