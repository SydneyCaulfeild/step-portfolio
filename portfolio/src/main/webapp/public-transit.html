    <p id="content">Last summer I had to travel to my job using OC Transpo, Ottawa's public transit system. Each trip, there and back, involved taking several buses and took nearly an hour and a half. This was the first time in my life I had to seriously rely on public transportation, and it got me thinking about others who may need public transit but don't have access. The graph below shows the percentage of accessible passenger stations and terminals in each province in 2016. As you can see, 100% is achievable but it is unfortunately not the reality in all provinces. Furthermore, it is important that we expand our data collection to cover all provinces and territories.</p>
